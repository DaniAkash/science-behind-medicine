					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>1988 - Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) was launched.</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>The challenges are huge!</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment fade-up">Must Vaccinate every person on the planet</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-up">This includes people in all the villages</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-up">Some communities are closed. They will not allow outsiders</li>
							<li class="fragment fade-up">Required millions of volunteers and billions of money</li>

						<h2>India stopped polio in 2011!</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>The infection was reduced by 99%</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>In 2016 there were only about 40 cases of Polio</h2>

						<h2>Pandemic</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>A pandemic is an outbreak of global proportions.</h2>
						<p class="fragment fade-up">It happens when a bacterium or novel virus becomes capable of spreading rapidly.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Wet Markets</h2>
						<p class="fragment fade-up">Wet markets sell live poultry, fish, reptiles, and mammals of every kind. Live-poultry markets (mostly chicken, pigeon, quail, ducks, geese, and a wide range of exotic wild-caught and farm-raised fowl) are usually separated from markets selling fish or red-meat animals, but the stalls can be near each other with no physical separation.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>One time, two animals that have different viruses came into contact</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-up">This produced a new virus that can infect humans</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>This virus spread through air and behaved just like common cold</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-up">But this caused severe respiration issues later and started killing the infected people.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>People who stayed in hotels with this virus, infected the entire hotels and places nearby.</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-up">People who went home from the hotel. Spread it across different countries.</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-up">This infection was so powerful, it infected doctors and nurses of the most advanced hospitals.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>The infection started spreading in November 2002</h2>
						<p class="fragment fade-up">On April 2003, Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory identified the virus</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-up">It was called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome</p>
						<h2 class="fragment fade-up">SARS</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>The world rushed to find a cure</h2>
						<p class="fragment fade-up">Turns out Human immune system was strong enough to fight off this disease!</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment fade-up">The source of the virus that caused this disease was found only on December 2017 on Bats near a village in china.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Pandemics are the biggest challenges faced by Scientists in today's medical industry</h3>
						<p class="fragment fade-up">Preparing for the unknown requires a new infrastructure</p>
